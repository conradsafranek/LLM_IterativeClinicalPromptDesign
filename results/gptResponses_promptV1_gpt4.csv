","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiated to his arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. These symptoms are classic for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). His initial troponin was markedly elevated, further supporting the diagnosis of ACS. The EKG did not show ST segment changes, but there was evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was given aspirin and heparin, and cardiology was consulted. The patient was admitted for further management. Given the patient's symptoms, history, and initial lab results, there is a high suspicion of a cardiac event.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to the arm and associated with shortness of breath. These symptoms are typical of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's elevated troponin levels and the physician's clinical impression of NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) further support this diagnosis. Despite the patient denying a history of myocardial infarction or seeing a cardiologist, his age and existing comorbidities place him at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, his history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit.

Type: EKG
Provider: Physician


Electrocardiogram Interpretation:
Sinus Rhythm
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Electronically Signed on 06-29-2023 14:25:51 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate that the patient has Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) but there is no mention of ST deviation. According to the additional information provided, the presence of LVH without ST deviation corresponds to a score of 1.

Therefore, the EKG findings can be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiated to his arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. These symptoms are typical of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's troponin levels were markedly elevated, which is indicative of myocardial injury. His EKG showed no ST segment changes but some left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was diagnosed with a non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was admitted for further management. Given the patient's age, past medical history, and the nature and severity of his symptoms, his history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electronically Signed on 06-29-2023 14:25:51 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There is no mention of ST deviation or repolarization changes. However, the presence of LVH can cause non-specific repolarization disturbances. 

Therefore, I would categorize this EKG as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

05:31 PM Pt ambulatory with steady gait to bathroom.
06:32 PM Report given to tele floor RN. Transport booked.


","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to the arm, associated with shortness of breath. These symptoms are classic for angina and could indicate an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's elevated troponin levels and the physician's clinical impressions of NSTEMI further support this. Although the patient denies a history of myocardial infarction or seeing a cardiologist, his age and existing comorbidities place him at a higher risk for heart disease. Therefore, the patient's history is [Highly suspicious (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The EKG findings indicate the presence of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH), which is a repolarization change. However, there is no mention of ST deviation. 

Therefore, the EKG would be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiated to his arm, associated with shortness of breath. His initial troponin was markedly elevated and he was diagnosed with NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction). These symptoms, along with his age and past medical history, make his case highly suspicious for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiates to the arm, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. These symptoms are highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's elevated troponin levels and the physician's clinical impression of NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) further support this suspicion. Although the patient denies a history of myocardial infarction or ACS, his age and existing comorbidities place him at high risk for cardiac events. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The EKG findings show sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There is no mention of ST deviation or repolarization changes. Therefore, the patient's EKG would fall into the category of ""No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin)"" according to the additional information provided.

Therefore, my choice is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to the arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. These symptoms are highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). His initial troponin level was markedly elevated, further supporting the suspicion of ACS. The ECG showed no ST segment changes but some left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was given aspirin and heparin, and cardiology was consulted. The final clinical impression was non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted for further management.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to the arm, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. His symptoms are exertional and worsen when lying flat. He has no history of acute coronary syndrome or early cardiovascular disease in the family. However, his initial troponin levels were markedly elevated and his ECG showed some left ventricular hypertrophy. He was diagnosed with NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) and admitted for further management. These findings are highly suggestive of a cardiac event. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

","The EKG findings show sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are no indications of ST deviation or repolarization changes. However, the presence of LVH may cause changes in the EKG that could be mistaken for ST deviation or repolarization changes. Therefore, this EKG would be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the arm, shortness of breath, and was mildly diaphoretic. His chest pain was pressure-like and worsened with exertion. His initial troponin levels were markedly elevated, and he was diagnosed with NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction). His ECG showed no ST segment changes but some left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was given aspirin and heparin, and was admitted to the hospital. Given the patient's age, medical history, and presenting symptoms, as well as the elevated troponin levels and diagnosis of NSTEMI, this patient's history is highly suspicious for cardiac disease.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ED with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the arm, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. These symptoms are concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). His initial troponin levels were markedly elevated, and he was diagnosed with a non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Although he denies a history of myocardial infarction or ACS, his age and medical history place him at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as:

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to his arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. His symptoms are exertional and worsen when lying flat. He has no history of acute coronary syndrome or early cardiovascular disease in the family. His initial troponin was markedly elevated and his ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no ST-segment changes. He was given aspirin and heparin, and was admitted for further management. His presentation and initial investigations are highly suggestive of a non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to his arm, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. These symptoms are classic for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). His initial troponin was markedly elevated, and he was diagnosed with a non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). His EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no ST segment changes. He was given aspirin and heparin, and cardiology was consulted. His symptoms improved with treatment. Given his age, medical history, and presenting symptoms, there is a high suspicion of a cardiac event.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease, presenting with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. These symptoms are highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's elevated troponin level and the clinical impression of NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) further support this suspicion. Although the patient denies a history of myocardial infarction or ACS, his age and existing comorbidities put him at high risk for cardiovascular events. Therefore, the patient's history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit.

However, there is no mention of ST deviation, left bundle branch block (LBBB), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or repolarization changes. Therefore, based on the information provided, the EKG findings do not suggest any significant abnormalities. 

My choice is: [Normal (0)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Provider: Registered Nurse


04:15 PM 3/10 chest pain for last 2 hours after using rowing machine at gym. EKG done. NKA. MD aware
of chest pain, no new orders at this time.
05:35 PM Troponin <6. Lidocaine patch applied per MAR. Pt reports chest pain improved to 1/10. NAD.
Resting comfortably in stretcher with side rails up and call button in reach.
06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with
steady gait, wife coming to pick him up.


","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. He has no significant past medical history and no family history of myocardial infarction. His pain is described as sharp and more towards the shoulder than the chest. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff. The EKG showed no ischemic changes and the troponin level was normal. The patient's chest pain improved significantly after the application of a lidocaine patch. The medical team suspects the pain to be mechanical in nature, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. 

Given the patient's age, the nature of the pain, the absence of risk factors for coronary artery disease, the normal EKG and troponin level, and the improvement with a lidocaine patch, the suspicion for a cardiac etiology for the chest pain is low. 

[ Slightly suspicious (0) ]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
Consider left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 07-14-2023 16:07:32 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate a sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. However, there is no mention of ST deviation, LBBB, LVH, or repolarization changes. Therefore, without further information, it is difficult to categorize the EKG findings accurately.

[Not enough information to determine EKG score]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pt report 2 hr chest pain, used rowing machine before. R sided. No SOB. Hasn’t taken anything for pain. No hx MI.
HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.
Case discussed with attending physician.

06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with
steady gait, wife coming to pick him up.


","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He has no significant past medical history and no family history of myocardial infarction. The pain is described as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and it's tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. The patient denies shortness of breath and radiation of pain. His EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes, and his troponin level was <6. The patient's pain improved with a lidocaine patch. The provider suspected the pain to be mechanical in etiology, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury, and not due to acute coronary syndrome, DVT/PE, or shoulder fracture. 

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and test results, the history is [Slightly suspicious (0)]. The patient's chest pain appears to be related to a potential musculoskeletal issue rather than a cardiac problem.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The EKG findings indicate a sinus rhythm with possible left atrial enlargement. However, there is no mention of ST deviation, left bundle branch block (LBBB), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or repolarization changes such as those seen with digoxin use. Therefore, without these specific findings, the EKG can be considered normal. 

So, my choice is: [Normal (0)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain was described as sharp and located more on the shoulder than the chest. The patient had no shortness of breath, no radiation of pain, and no history of heart problems. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff. The EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes, and the troponin level was normal. The patient's pain improved after a lidocaine patch was applied. The provider suspected the pain to be mechanical in nature, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury, and recommended the patient to follow up with his primary care physician if the pain persists. Given the patient's presentation, physical examination findings, and the improvement of his symptoms after the application of a lidocaine patch, his history is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who presented with right-sided chest pain after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. The patient denies shortness of breath and radiation of pain. The EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes, and troponin levels were normal. The patient's pain improved after a lidocaine patch was applied. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems. The suspected cause of the chest pain is mechanical, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. 

Given the patient's age, lack of significant past medical history, the nature and location of the pain, the improvement with lidocaine, and the normal EKG and troponin levels, the patient's history is not highly suspicious for a cardiac event.

06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with
steady gait, wife coming to pick him up.


","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp and is more localized to the shoulder than the chest. The patient denies shortness of breath and radiation of pain. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems. An EKG showed no signs of ischemia or ST segment changes. The patient's troponin levels were also normal. The chest pain is suspected to be mechanical in nature, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. The patient's symptoms improved after a lidocaine patch was applied. 

Given the patient's presentation, normal EKG and troponin levels, and improvement of symptoms with a lidocaine patch, the history is not highly suspicious for a cardiac event. However, the presence of chest pain, even if it is suspected to be mechanical, warrants some level of suspicion. 

[Moderately suspicious (1)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain was sharp and more towards the shoulder than the chest. There was no shortness of breath or radiation of pain. The patient had no personal or family history of heart problems. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff. EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes and troponin levels were normal. The pain improved with a lidocaine patch. The chest pain was suspected to be mechanical in etiology, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. There was low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or shoulder fracture. 

Given the patient's age, lack of significant past medical history, lack of risk factors for cardiac disease, the nature and location of the pain, and the normal EKG and troponin levels, the patient's history is [Slightly suspicious (0)] for a cardiac etiology of the chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. He has no significant past medical history and no family history of heart problems. The pain is described as sharp, more in the shoulder than the chest, and is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. The EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes, and his troponin levels were normal. The medical team suspects the pain to be mechanical in nature, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. 

Given the patient's age, the nature and location of the pain, the absence of other cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, the normal EKG and troponin levels, and the fact that the pain started during physical activity, it seems less likely that this is a cardiac event. However, chest pain in a 50-year-old male should not be completely ignored as a potential cardiac symptom. 

[Moderately suspicious (1)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The EKG findings indicate a sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. However, there is no mention of ST deviation, left bundle branch block (LBBB), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or repolarization changes such as those caused by digoxin. Therefore, based on the information provided, the EKG appears to be normal.

[Normal (0)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

• Chest Pain
Pt report 2 hr chest pain, used rowing machine before. R sided. No SOB. Hasn’t taken anything for pain. No hx MI.
HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, located more in the shoulder than the chest, and tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems. The EKG showed no signs of ischemia and the troponin level was normal. The patient's pain improved with a lidocaine patch. The medical team suspects the pain is mechanical in nature, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. 

Given the patient's age, the nature and location of the pain, the lack of cardiac risk factors, and the negative cardiac workup, the patient's history is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with

","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. He has no significant past medical history, no personal history of heart problems, and no family history of myocardial infarction. His pain is described as sharp, more in the shoulder than the chest, and is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. The pain does not radiate and he denies shortness of breath. His EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes, and his troponin levels were normal. The chest pain is suspected to be mechanical in etiology, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. The patient's vital signs were stable and his physical exam was largely unremarkable. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care provider if his shoulder pain doesn't improve. 

Given this information, the patient's history is [Slightly suspicious (0)]. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a musculoskeletal issue rather than a cardiac one, and his EKG and troponin levels do not indicate a cardiac event.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp and more towards the shoulder than the chest. He has no history of heart problems or any family history of myocardial infarction. His EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes and his troponin levels were normal. The pain was suspected to be mechanical in etiology, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. His pain improved after a lidocaine patch was applied. Given the patient's age, lack of cardiac history, and the nature and location of the pain, it is less likely that this is cardiac in origin.

There is no personal or family history of heart problems. The EKG is non-ischemic without any ST segment changes and troponin levels are normal. The pain improved after applying a lidocaine patch.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and there is tenderness on palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. He has no history of heart problems or any family history of myocardial infarction. His EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes, and his troponin levels were normal. The patient's pain improved after a lidocaine patch was applied. The physician suspected the pain to be mechanical in etiology, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care provider if his shoulder pain doesn't improve. 

Given the patient's presentation, the lack of cardiac risk factors, and the improvement in symptoms with a lidocaine patch, the patient's history is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He has no significant past medical history and no family history of myocardial infarction. His pain is described as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. His EKG showed no ischemic changes and his troponin levels were normal. The patient's pain improved after a lidocaine patch was applied. The physician's differential diagnosis included, but doubted, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and fracture. The physician favored a mild sprain of the shoulder but did not exclude a more serious rotator cuff injury. 

Given the patient's age, the nature of the pain, the absence of shortness of breath, the normal EKG and troponin levels, and the improvement with lidocaine patch, the suspicion for a cardiac etiology of the chest pain is low. However, the patient was exercising when the pain started, which could increase suspicion for a cardiac cause. 

[Slightly suspicious (0)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as:

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, more in the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. The patient has no history of heart problems or any family history of myocardial infarction. An EKG showed no ischemic changes and the troponin level was less than 6. The patient's pain improved to 1/10 after a lidocaine patch was applied. The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care provider if his shoulder pain doesn't improve. Given the patient's history, symptoms, and the results of the investigations, it is more likely that the chest pain is due to a musculoskeletal issue rather than a cardiac one.

His EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes and his troponin level was less than 6. The patient's pain improved after a lidocaine patch was applied. The medical team suspects a mechanical etiology for the chest pain, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician if his shoulder pain does not improve. 

Given the patient's age, lack of significant past medical history, absence of cardiac risk factors, and the nature and location of the pain, the history is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electronically Signed on 07-14-2023 16:07:32 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate a sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. However, there is no mention of ST deviation, left bundle branch block (LBBB), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or repolarization changes. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no evidence of non-specific repolarization disturbance or significant ST deviation.

My choice is: [Normal (0)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Provider: Registered Nurse


04:15 PM 3/10 chest pain for last 2 hours after using rowing machine at gym. EKG done. NKA. MD aware
of chest pain, no new orders at this time.
05:35 PM Troponin <6. Lidocaine patch applied per MAR. Pt reports chest pain improved to 1/10. NAD.
Resting comfortably in stretcher with side rails up and call button in reach.
06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with
steady gait, wife coming to pick him up.


","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain that started after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp and more towards the shoulder than the chest. There is no history of shortness of breath, radiation of pain, or previous heart problems. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff. The EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes, and the troponin level was less than 6. The pain improved with a lidocaine patch. Given these findings, the chest pain is suspected to be mechanical in etiology, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury, rather than cardiac in origin. 

[Moderately suspicious (1)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The EKG findings indicate a sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. However, there is no mention of ST deviation, LBBB, LVH, or repolarization changes. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to definitively categorize the EKG findings.

[Not enough information to determine EKG score]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, more in the shoulder than the chest, and does not radiate. He has no shortness of breath. His EKG showed no signs of ischemia and his troponin levels were normal, suggesting that his chest pain is not due to a cardiac event. His physical examination was unremarkable except for tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff. The pain improved with a lidocaine patch. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems. The physician suspects the pain might be due to a mechanical issue, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. 

Based on this information, the patient's history is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

","The EKG findings indicate a sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. However, there is no mention of ST deviation, Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH), or repolarization changes. Therefore, without these specific findings, it's difficult to categorize the EKG based on the provided scoring system.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He has no significant past medical history and no family history of myocardial infarction. He denied shortness of breath and the pain did not radiate. The pain was described as sharp and was more on the shoulder than the chest. On examination, there was tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff. EKG showed no ischemic changes and troponin levels were normal. The pain improved with a lidocaine patch. The patient was discharged with advice to follow up with his primary care provider if his shoulder pain doesn't get better. 

Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and test results, his history is not highly suspicious for a cardiac event. The pain seems to be more related to a possible musculoskeletal issue, possibly related to his exercise at the gym. 

[ Slightly suspicious (0) ]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

","The EKG findings indicate a sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. However, there is no mention of ST deviation, LBBB, LVH, or repolarization changes. Therefore, without additional information, it is difficult to definitively categorize the EKG findings.

06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with
steady gait, wife coming to pick him up.


","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain after using a rowing machine at the gym. He has no significant past medical history or family history of heart problems. His pain is described as sharp and more towards the shoulder than the chest. He denies shortness of breath and the pain does not radiate. His physical examination was unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and normal breath sounds. His EKG did not show any signs of ischemia and his troponin levels were normal. The pain improved with the application of a lidocaine patch. The medical team suspects the pain to be mechanical in nature, possibly related to a rotator cuff injury. 

Given this information, the patient's history is not highly suggestive of a cardiac etiology for his chest pain. His symptoms improved with a lidocaine patch, which suggests a musculoskeletal cause rather than a cardiac one. His EKG and troponin levels were also normal, which further reduces the likelihood of a cardiac cause. 

[Slightly suspicious (0)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain after using a rowing machine. The pain is described as sharp, more in the shoulder than the chest, and is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. The patient denies shortness of breath and radiation of pain. There is no personal or family history of heart problems. The EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes and the troponin level was normal. The patient's pain improved with a lidocaine patch. The clinical impression is that the chest pain is likely mechanical in origin, possibly related to a mild sprain or rotator cuff injury. 

Given the patient's presentation, the absence of risk factors for cardiac disease, the normal EKG and troponin level, and the improvement with a lidocaine patch, the suspicion for a cardiac cause of the chest pain is low. 

[Slightly suspicious (0)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with chest pain after using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, right-sided, more shoulder than chest, and tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. There is no history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. The patient denies shortness of breath and radiation of pain. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems. The EKG was non-ischemic without any ST segment changes and troponin levels were normal. The patient's chest pain improved after the application of a lidocaine patch. The patient's symptoms and the absence of significant risk factors for cardiac disease make a cardiac etiology of the chest pain less likely. The pain seems more likely to be musculoskeletal in nature, possibly related to exercise.

Considered but doubt ACS. Low risk for PE. Doubt fracture, no significant trauma. Favor mild sprain of
shoulder but cannot exclude more serious rotator cuff injury. Would recommend close follow-up with
PMD as may need MRI and ortho or sports ref if symptoms persist.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

 NOTE [#2] IN CURRENT ENCOUNTER
((CURRENT Visit Encounter Note))

Last Edited: 2023-08-01 16:11:00
Type: ED Visit
Provider: Registered Nurse


12:24 PM 54F with several hours of left sided chest pain. Radiates to neck. +pleuritic. Reports several of
her family have had PEs in the past but doesn’t think she has had one. No cough, fever, SOB. No hx MI.
Received aspirin and EKG at triage. Labs/IV. Placed on monitor, side rails in place, call bell in reach.
01:03 PM Chest pain still persistent 5/10, MD aware, nitroglycerin administered per MAR.
01:25 PM Patient reports continued chest pain 4/10, MD notified no new orders at this time.
02:41 PM Chest pain is now resolved. No other new or worsening symptoms.
03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.


","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and tobacco use disorder. She presents with left-sided chest pain that radiates to her neck, worsens with deep breaths, and is associated with mild nausea. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism but no personal history of thromboembolic disease. She denies any known history of CAD and has no records of stress testing. Her EKG showed a new left bundle branch block, and her troponin levels were mildly elevated but stable. Her chest pain resolved with aspirin/nitroglycerin. Given her risk factors and symptoms, there is a moderate suspicion of a cardiac event. 

[Moderately suspicious (1)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
Left bundle branch block
Possible left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by


","The EKG shows a sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and possible left atrial enlargement. According to the additional information provided, an EKG with no ST deviation but with LBBB is scored as 1 point. Therefore, based on the patient's EKG findings, I would categorize it as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and tobacco use disorder. She presented with left-sided chest pain that radiates to her neck and worsens with deep breaths. She also has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. Her ECG showed a new left bundle branch block and her troponin levels were mildly elevated but stable. Despite her chest pain resolving with aspirin/nitroglycerin, the patient's history of cardiovascular risk factors, her symptoms, and her ECG changes are concerning for potential cardiac ischemia. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, type II diabetes, and tobacco use disorder. She presented with left-sided chest pain that radiates to her neck, worsens with deep breaths, and is associated with mild nausea. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism but no personal history of thromboembolic disease. Her ECG showed a new left bundle branch block and mildly elevated but stable troponin levels. Her chest pain resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin. Given her risk factors (age, diabetes, smoking, and peripheral artery disease), symptoms, and ECG changes, there is a high suspicion of a cardiac etiology for her chest pain, possibly ischemic heart disease. The fact that her pain resolved with nitroglycerin further supports this. Although a pulmonary embolism was considered, it was ruled out with a normal d-dimer test. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and tobacco use disorder. She presents with left-sided chest pain radiating to her neck, worsened by deep breathing, and mild nausea. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism but no personal history of thromboembolic disease. Her EKG showed a new left bundle branch block of unclear chronicity and mildly elevated but stable troponin levels. Her chest pain resolved with aspirin/nitroglycerin. Given her risk factors and symptoms, she is at a high risk for cardiac disease, particularly ischemic heart disease. Her chest pain, which is pleuritic and radiates to her neck, combined with her risk factors and EKG changes, are concerning for a cardiac etiology. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The patient's EKG shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB) but there is no mention of ST deviation. According to the additional information provided, the presence of LBBB without ST deviation would be scored as 1 point. 

Therefore, the EKG findings can be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and tobacco use, presenting with left-sided chest pain that radiates to her neck and worsens with deep respirations. She also has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. Despite no personal history of CAD, her EKG showed a new left bundle branch block and mildly elevated but stable troponin levels. Her chest pain resolved with aspirin/nitroglycerin. Given her risk factors, symptoms, and EKG findings, this presentation is concerning for potential cardiac ischemia. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, type II diabetes, and tobacco use disorder. She presented with left-sided chest pain that radiated to her neck, worsened with deep breaths, and was associated with mild nausea. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism but no personal history of thromboembolic disease. Her EKG showed a new left bundle branch block and her troponin was mildly elevated but stable. Her chest pain resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin. Given her risk factors and presentation, there is a moderate suspicion for a cardiac event, such as myocardial infarction. However, her chest pain has resolved and she is being referred for further evaluation at a chest pain center. 

[Moderately suspicious (1)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and tobacco use disorder. She presented with left-sided chest pain that radiated to her neck and worsened with deep breaths. She also had mild nausea but no vomiting. The patient has a family history of pulmonary embolism but no personal history of thromboembolic disease. Her EKG showed a new left bundle branch block, and her troponin levels were mildly elevated but stable. Her chest pain resolved after administration of aspirin and nitroglycerin. Given her age, past medical history, and symptoms, this patient has a moderate risk of having a cardiac event. Her symptoms and EKG findings are concerning for possible cardiac ischemia. However, her chest pain resolved with nitroglycerin and aspirin, and her troponin levels were only mildly elevated. Therefore, while her history is concerning, it is not definitive for a cardiac event.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder. She presented with left-sided chest pain that radiated to her neck, worsened with deep breaths, and was associated with mild nausea. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, but her d-dimer levels were normal, making PE unlikely. Her ECG showed a new left bundle branch block, and her troponin levels were mildly elevated but stable. Her chest pain resolved with aspirin/nitro. Given her risk factors (age, diabetes, tobacco use, and peripheral artery disease), her symptoms, and her ECG and troponin findings, there is a moderate to high suspicion of cardiac etiology, possibly ischemic heart disease. However, further evaluation, such as stress testing, is needed to confirm this. [Moderately suspicious (1)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The EKG findings show a sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and possible left atrial enlargement. There is no mention of ST deviation. According to the additional information provided, the presence of LBBB without ST deviation would categorize the EKG as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, type II diabetes, and tobacco use disorder.

tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
Left bundle branch block
Possible left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by


","The EKG findings show a sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and possible left atrial enlargement. According to the additional information provided, if there is no ST deviation but there is LBBB, the score would be 1 point. Therefore, I would categorize this EKG as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, type II diabetes, and tobacco use disorder, presenting with left-sided chest pain radiating to the neck, pleuritic in nature, and associated with mild nausea. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism but no personal history of thromboembolic disease. Her EKG showed a new left bundle branch block and her troponin levels were mildly elevated but stable. Her chest pain resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin. Given her risk factors including age, tobacco use, and peripheral artery disease, her symptoms are concerning for a cardiac etiology, potentially ischemic heart disease. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of

deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Therefore, the EKG findings can be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

12:24 PM 54F with several hours of left sided chest pain. Radiates to neck. +pleuritic. Reports several of
her family have had PEs in the past but doesn’t think she has had one. No cough, fever, SOB. No hx MI.
Received aspirin and EKG at triage. Labs/IV. Placed on monitor, side rails in place, call bell in reach.
01:03 PM Chest pain still persistent 5/10, MD aware, nitroglycerin administered per MAR.
01:25 PM Patient reports continued chest pain 4/10, MD notified no new orders at this time.
02:41 PM Chest pain is now resolved. No other new or worsening symptoms.
03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.


","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, presenting with left-sided chest pain that radiates to her neck and worsens with deep respirations. She also has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. The EKG showed a new left bundle branch block of unclear chronicity and her troponin levels were mildly elevated but stable. The chest pain resolved after administration of aspirin and nitroglycerin. Given the patient's history and symptoms, there is a moderate suspicion of cardiac etiology, particularly ischemic heart disease. The patient's risk factors (age, diabetes, smoking, and peripheral artery disease) and symptoms (chest pain radiating to the neck, new left bundle branch block on EKG, and mildly elevated troponin) are concerning for cardiac ischemia. However, her chest pain resolved with nitroglycerin and aspirin, and she is scheduled for further evaluation with a stress test. 

[Moderately suspicious (1)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Possible left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by


","The EKG shows a sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and possible left atrial enlargement. There is no mention of ST deviation. According to the additional information provided, the presence of LBBB without ST deviation scores 1 point. Therefore, the EKG findings can be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:

tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was

MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of peripheral artery disease, type II diabetes, and tobacco use disorder, presenting with left-sided chest pain that radiates to her neck and worsens with deep breaths. She also has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. The ECG showed a new left bundle branch block and mildly elevated but stable troponin levels. Chest pain resolved with aspirin/nitroglycerin. The combination of her risk factors (age, smoking, diabetes, peripheral artery disease), symptoms (chest pain radiating to neck), and findings (new left bundle branch block, elevated troponin) make her history highly suspicious for cardiac disease. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The EKG findings indicate the presence of a left bundle branch block (LBBB) which is a type of non-specific repolarization disturbance. There is no mention of ST deviation in the EKG interpretation. Therefore, according to the additional information provided, this would score 1 point.

So, the EKG findings can be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient is a 38-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, but a strong family history of cardiac disease. She presents with chest pain, radiating to the left shoulder and neck, and associated nausea. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, and exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks. Her ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, and her troponin levels are elevated. These symptoms and findings are highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and the patient has been admitted for further cardiac workup. Therefore, her history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Sinus rhythm
ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate an abnormality in the ST & T wave, suggesting possible anterior ischemia. This is a significant ST deviation, which is not attributed to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin use based on the information provided. 

Therefore, the EKG findings can be categorized as [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate a ST & T wave abnormality, which could suggest anterior ischemia. This is a significant ST deviation, not attributed to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin use. 

Therefore, the EKG findings would be categorized as [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and neck, with a pressure-like sensation. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. She also reports exertional dyspnea. The patient has a family history of early heart disease, with her mother having a heart attack at 42 and her father dying suddenly at 50. Her ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads and her troponin levels are elevated. These factors all contribute to a high suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate an ST & T wave abnormality, which suggests possible anterior ischemia. This falls under the category of ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin. Therefore, the EKG score would be [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate an ST & T wave abnormality, which suggests anterior ischemia. This is a significant ST deviation and is not noted to be due to left bundle branch block (LBBB), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or digoxin use. 

Therefore, the EKG would be categorized as [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, associated with nausea.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

((CURRENT Visit Encounter Note))

Last Edited: 2023-08-08 09:14:00
Type: EKG
Provider: Physician


Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate an ST & T wave abnormality, which could suggest anterior ischemia. This is a significant ST deviation and not due to Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH), or digoxin use as per the additional information provided. 

Therefore, the EKG score would be [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.

","The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a family history of early cardiac events. She presents with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and neck, which she describes as pressure-like. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, which have been increasing in frequency. She also reports exertional dyspnea over the last few weeks. Her ECG shows t-wave inversions in the anterior leads, and her troponin levels are elevated. These findings, along with her symptoms and family history, are highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, her history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further

09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient is a 38-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, but she presents with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and neck, which she describes as pressure-like. She also reports nausea and exertional dyspnea. She has a family history of early heart disease, with her mother having a heart attack at the age of 42 and her father dying suddenly at 50. Her ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, and her troponin levels are elevated. These findings are suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, her history is highly suspicious for a cardiac condition. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate an ST & T wave abnormality, which suggests possible anterior ischemia. This is a significant ST deviation, not attributed to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin use.

Therefore, the EKG score would be [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a strong family history of heart disease, presenting with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, associated with nausea and exertional dyspnea. The pain is described as pressure-like and has been increasing in frequency over the past few days. She has an abnormal ECG with T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, and an elevated troponin level. These symptoms and findings are highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.

She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate an ST & T wave abnormality, which suggests potential anterior ischemia. This is a significant ST deviation and is not attributed to Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH), or digoxin use based on the information provided.

Therefore, the EKG findings can be categorized as: [Significant ST deviation (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient is a 38-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, but presents with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and neck, associated with nausea and exertional dyspnea. She has a family history of early heart disease. Her ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, and her troponin levels are elevated. These findings are indicative of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care


","The patient has the following risk factors: positive family history (mother had a heart attack at 42 and father died suddenly at 50). There is no mention of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, or smoking in the patient's history. Therefore, the patient has 1-2 risk factors.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care


","The patient has a positive family history of cardiovascular disease, with her mother having a heart attack at 42 and her father dying suddenly at 50. She has also been diagnosed with anxiety, which can be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, there is no mention of the patient having hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity, or being a smoker. Therefore, the patient has 1-2 risk factors.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal

elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further

Provider: Registered Nurse


09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with chest pain that radiates to her left shoulder and neck, associated with nausea and exertional dyspnea. She has a family history of early heart disease, with her mother having a heart attack at 42 and her father dying suddenly at 50. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain recently. Her ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads and her troponin levels are elevated. These findings are suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Despite her young age and lack of personal history of cardiovascular disease, her symptoms, ECG changes, elevated troponin, and family history of early heart disease are highly concerning for a cardiac event.

[Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","The EKG findings indicate an ST & T wave abnormality, which suggests potential anterior ischemia. This is a significant ST deviation, not attributed to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin use based on the information provided.

Therefore, the EKG would be categorized as [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Type: ED Visit
Provider: Physician


Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.
