","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

""""""","Based on the EKG interpretation provided in the encounter note, the patient has left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy falls under the category of ""Non-specific repolarization disturbance"" according to the prompt. Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain, the following information is provided:
- Duration: 3 hours
- Quality: Pressure-like
- Radiation: Arm
- Associated symptoms: Shortness of breath
- Exertional: Yes
- Pleuritic: No
- Family history of early cardiovascular disease: No
- Previous history of ACS: No

Based on this information, the patient's history is highly suspicious as it includes traditional features of typical MI presentation, such as severe chest pain radiating to the arm and associated shortness of breath. Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain, the following information can be gathered:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The chest pain started approximately 3 hours ago and is described as pressure-like and exertional.
- The pain radiates to the left shoulder but not to the back.
- There is associated shortness of breath that worsens when laying flat.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and family history of early cardiovascular disease.
- The patient does not see a cardiologist and has no history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), recent surgery, immobilization, or hormone use.
- There are no fevers, chills, or infectious symptoms reported.

Based on this information, the patient's history can be considered [Moderately suspicious (1)]. The chest pain is exertional and radiates to the left shoulder, which are traditional features of a typical myocardial infarction (MI) presentation.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

""""""","Based on the EKG interpretation provided in the encounter note, the patient has left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy falls under the category of ""Non-specific repolarization disturbance"" in the HEART score. Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain, the following information is provided:
- Duration: 3 hours
- Quality: Pressure-like
- Radiation: Radiates to left shoulder
- Associated symptoms: Shortness of breath
- Exertional: Yes
- Pleuritic: No
- Family history: Denies family history of early cardiovascular disease

Based on this information, the patient's history is highly suspicious as it includes traditional features of typical MI presentation, such as severe chest pain radiating to the left shoulder, associated shortness of breath, and exertional nature of the pain. Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain, the following information can be gathered:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The chest pain started approximately 3 hours ago and is described as pressure-like and exertional.
- The pain radiates to the left shoulder but not to the back.
- There is associated shortness of breath that worsens when laying flat.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and family history of early cardiovascular disease.

Based on this information, the patient's history subscore is [Moderately suspicious (1)]. The patient's chest pain has some traditional features of a typical myocardial infarction (MI) presentation, such as exertional nature and radiation to the left shoulder. However, the history lacks specific chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and reactions to sublingual nitrates, which would make it highly suspicious.","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI).

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:

""""""","Based on the information provided in the encounter note, the patient's EKG interpretation mentions sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy falls under the category of non-specific repolarization disturbance according to the prompt. Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes.

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain, radiating to the left shoulder, associated with shortness of breath, and worsened when laying flat, as well as the absence of ripping/tearing quality and pleuritic pain, the patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain, the following information can be gathered:
- The patient has been experiencing severe left-sided chest pressure for 3 hours.
- The pain radiates to the arm.
- The patient also has associated shortness of breath.
- The pain is pressure-like and exertional.
- The pain does not radiate to the back and has no ripping/tearing quality.

- The patient does not see a cardiologist.
- The patient has no history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), recent surgery, immobilization, hormones, or smoking.
- There are no fevers, chills, or infectious symptoms.

Based on this information, the patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)] for a myocardial infarction (MI).

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

- currently treated diabetes mellitus: Not mentioned in the encounter notes.
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker: Denies smoking in encounter note #1.
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: Mentioned in encounter notes #1, #3, #5, and #6.
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: Mentioned in encounter notes #1, #3, and #5.
- family history of coronary artery disease: Denies family history in encounter note #1.
- current obesity (BMI >30): BMI is not mentioned in the encounter notes.
- a history of significant atherosclerosis: Not mentioned in the encounter notes.

Based on the encounter notes, the patient has the following risk factors: 
- current or recent smoker: NO
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: YES
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: YES
- family history of coronary artery disease: NO
- current obesity (BMI >30): NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION
- a history of significant atherosclerosis: NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION

Step 2) The patient has 2 risk factors: diagnosed and/or treated hypertension and diagnosed hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the patient's risk factor subscore is [1-2 risk factors (1)].","2","1","1",2,2,8

- The pain radiates to the left shoulder but not to the back.
- There is associated shortness of breath that worsens when lying flat.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and family history of early cardiovascular disease.
- The patient does not see a cardiologist and has no history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), recent surgery, immobilization, or hormone use.
- There are no fevers, chills, or infectious symptoms reported.

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

I am going to obtain a respiratory viral panel, sputum culture and chest x ray. I am concerned about a pneumonia. I will start antibiotics and call him back with his lab results.



""""""","Step 1) Let's go through each risk factor and determine if it is present in the patient's encounter notes:

- currently treated diabetes mellitus: Not mentioned in the encounter notes.
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker: Denies smoking in the current encounter note.
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension mentioned in multiple encounter notes.

Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain, the following information can be gathered:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The chest pain started approximately 3 hours ago and is described as pressure-like and exertional.
- The pain radiates to the left shoulder but not to the back.
- There is associated shortness of breath, which worsens when laying flat.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI), family history of early cardiovascular disease, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), recent surgery, immobilization, hormones, and smoking.
- There are no fevers, chills, or infectious symptoms reported.

Based on this information, the patient's history subscore can be determined as follows:
- The patient's chest pain has traditional features of typical MI presentation, such as severity, radiation to the arm, and associated shortness of breath.
- The pain is exertional, which is a non-traditional element of typical MI presentation.
- The pain does not have clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, or reactions to sublingual nitrates.

Considering these factors, the patient's history subscore is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

- The pain radiates to the left shoulder.
- There is associated shortness of breath that worsens when laying flat.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction and family history of early cardiovascular disease.

Considering this information, the patient's history subscore would be [Moderately suspicious (1)].

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain that started 2 hours ago, which was triggered by using a rowing machine at the gym, and the description of the pain as sharp and right-sided, more in the shoulder than the chest, the patient's history subscore would be [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Consider left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 07-14-2023 16:07:32 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain that started about 2 hours ago, with a clear trigger (using a rowing machine at the gym), and localized to the right side with more shoulder involvement, the patient's history is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain that started about 2 hours ago, with a clear trigger (using a rowing machine at the gym), and localized to the right side with more shoulder involvement than chest, the patient's history subscore would be [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
Consider left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 07-14-2023 16:07:32 EDT by



""""""","Based on the provided EKG interpretation, the note mentions sinus rhythm and the consideration of left atrial enlargement. There is no mention of significant ST-segment deviations or repolarization abnormalities. Therefore, the EKG subscore would be [Normal (0)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Pt report 2 hr chest pain, used rowing machine before. R sided. No SOB. Hasn’t taken anything for pain. No hx MI.
HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Consider left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 07-14-2023 16:07:32 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain that started about 2 hours ago, with a clear trigger of using a rowing machine at the gym, and the pain being described as sharp and right-sided, it can be concluded that the patient's history is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.

MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

personally performed medically appropriate history and physical exam and the MDM:
On my exam:
Comfortable in NAD with reproducible TTP over R shoulder and chest wall. NRR, CTAB.
My differential includes:
Considered but doubt ACS. Low risk for PE. Doubt fracture, no significant trauma. Favor mild sprain of
shoulder but cannot exclude more serious rotator cuff injury. Would recommend close follow-up with
PMD as may need MRI and ortho or sports ref if symptoms persist.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain that started after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest and radiating into the neck, and worsened with deep respirations, along with the presence of pleuritic pain, the patient's history subscore would be [Moderately suspicious (1)]. These symptoms are consistent with traditional features of a typical myocardial infarction presentation.","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI).

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

She says that with her leg pain, it has been very difficult to walk much and she has been staying in bed or
on the couch more. She noticed that over the past month, when she first stands in the morning, her
bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain starting after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest and radiating into the neck, and worsened by deep respirations, along with the presence of pleuritic pain and mild nausea, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction (MI).

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

Provider: Physician


Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Chief Complaint

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Possible left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by



""""""","Based on the EKG interpretation provided in the encounter note, the patient has a left bundle branch block and possible left atrial enlargement. These findings fall under the category of ""Non-specific repolarization disturbance"" according to the given options. Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by



""""""","Based on the EKG interpretation provided in the encounter note, the patient has a left bundle branch block and possible left atrial enlargement. These findings fall under the category of ""Non-specific repolarization disturbance"" as per the scoring criteria. Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]

03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.



""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain that started after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest and radiating into the neck, and worsened with deep respirations, along with the presence of pleuritic pain, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain starting after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest and radiating into the neck, and worsened by deep respirations, as well as the presence of pleuritic pain, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for a myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain starting after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest and radiating into the neck, and worsened by deep respirations, as well as the presence of pleuritic pain, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited

Pt reporting that over the past month, she has had significant pain in her soles first thing in the morning.
She says that with her leg pain, it has been very difficult to walk much and she has been staying in bed or
on the couch more. She noticed that over the past month, when she first stands in the morning, her
bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain starting after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest and radiating into the neck, and worsened by deep respirations, as well as the presence of pleuritic pain, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction (MI).

Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

""""""","Step 1) Let's go through each risk factor and determine if it is present in the patient's combined encounter notes:

- Currently treated diabetes mellitus: YES (mentioned in Encounter Note #1)
- Current or recent (<90 days) smoker: YES (mentioned in Encounter Note #1 and Encounter Note #5)
- Diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: NO (not mentioned in any encounter notes)
- Diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: YES (mentioned in Encounter Note #5)
- Family history of coronary artery disease: NO (not mentioned in any encounter notes)
- Current obesity (BMI >30): YES (mentioned in Encounter Note #5)
- History of significant atherosclerosis: YES (mentioned in Encounter Note #1)

Step 2) Based on the presence of risk factors, the patient's risk factor subscore is [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]. 

Reasoning: The patient has the following risk factors: currently treated diabetes mellitus, current or recent smoker, diagnosed hypercholesterolemia, current obesity, and a history of significant atherosclerosis. This totals to 5 risk factors. Therefore, the patient falls into the category of "">= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease"" with a risk factor subscore of 2.

Chief Complaint

Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient's history of present illness (HPI) indicates that she is a 54-year-old woman with chest pain that started after breakfast. The pain is localized to the left side of her chest and radiates into her neck. It is described as sharp and worsens with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea. There is no mention of clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, or reactions to sublingual nitrates. However, the history does include traditional features of typical MI presentation, such as chest pain radiating to the neck and sharp pain worsened by deep respirations. Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

S: 54 yo presents for problem visit
Pt reporting that over the past month, she has had significant pain in her soles first thing in the morning.
She says that with her leg pain, it has been very difficult to walk much and she has been staying in bed or
on the couch more. She noticed that over the past month, when she first stands in the morning, her
bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain that started after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest and radiating into the neck, and worsened with deep respirations, as well as the presence of pleuritic chest pain and mild nausea, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for a myocardial infarction (MI).

You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

She says that with her leg pain, it has been very difficult to walk much and she has been staying in bed or
on the couch more. She noticed that over the past month, when she first stands in the morning, her
bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

""""""","Step 1) Let's go through each risk factor and determine if it is present in the patient's encounter notes:

- currently treated diabetes mellitus: YES (diabetes mellitus is mentioned in Encounter Note #1)
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker: YES (tobacco use disorder is mentioned in Encounter Note #1 and Encounter Note #5)
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: NO (no mention of hypertension in the encounter notes)
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: YES (Atorvastatin is mentioned in Encounter Note #5)
- family history of coronary artery disease: YES (strong family history of pulmonary embolism is mentioned in Encounter Note #1)
- current obesity (BMI >30): YES (obesity is mentioned in Encounter Note #5)
- a history of significant atherosclerosis: YES (past medical history of peripheral artery disease is mentioned in Encounter Note #1)

Step 2) Based on the presence of the risk factors, the patient's risk factor subscore is [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]. 

Reasoning: The patient has the following risk factors: currently treated diabetes mellitus, current or recent smoker, diagnosed hypercholesterolemia, family history of coronary artery disease, current obesity, and a history of significant atherosclerosis. This totals to 6 risk factors, which falls into the category of [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)].","1","1","2",1,1,6

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

""""""","Based on the EKG interpretation provided, the patient has ST & T wave abnormality, with consideration of anterior ischemia. This indicates a non-specific repolarization disturbance. Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

ASSESSMENT/PLAN
Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further

ASSESSMENT/PLAN
Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care



""""""","Step 1) Let's go through each risk factor and determine if it is present in the patient's combined encounter notes:

- currently treated diabetes mellitus: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- family history of coronary artery disease: Patient's mother had a heart attack at 42. YES
- current obesity (BMI >30): No information about the patient's BMI. Not enough information.
- a history of significant atherosclerosis: No information about coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. Not enough information.

Step 2) Based on the information provided, we can determine the patient's risk factor subscore:

The patient has a family history of coronary artery disease, which counts as one risk factor. Since there is not enough information to determine the presence of other risk factors or a history of significant atherosclerosis, the risk factor subscore is [1-2 risk factors (1)].","2",NA,"1",0,2,NA

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like and continuous, along with multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days and trouble sleeping due to pain, the patient's history subscore is [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN
Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care



""""""","Step 1) Let's go through each risk factor and determine if it is present in the patient's combined encounter notes:

- currently treated diabetes mellitus: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- family history of coronary artery disease: The patient's mother had a heart attack at 42. YES
- current obesity (BMI >30): BMI is not mentioned in the notes. NO
- a history of significant atherosclerosis: No mention of coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. NO

Step 2) Based on the information provided, the patient's risk factor subscore is [1-2 risk factors (1)]. The patient has a family history of coronary artery disease, which counts as one risk factor.","2","1","1",0,2,6

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like and continuous, along with associated symptoms such as nausea and trouble sleeping, and the presence of t-wave inversions in the anterior leads on the ECG, the patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","Based on the patient's history of chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like and continuous, along with associated symptoms such as nausea and multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, the patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care



""""""","Step 1) Let's go through each risk factor and determine if it is present in the patient's combined encounter notes:

- currently treated diabetes mellitus: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- family history of coronary artery disease: The patient's mother had a heart attack at 42. YES
- current obesity (BMI >30): No information provided about the patient's BMI. Not enough information.
- a history of significant atherosclerosis: No information provided about coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. Not enough information.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further

     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care



""""""","Step 1) Let's go through each risk factor and determine if it is present in the patient's combined encounter notes:

- currently treated diabetes mellitus: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker: Not mentioned in the notes. NO
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: Not mentioned in the notes. NO

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by



""""""","Based on the EKG interpretation provided, the patient has ST & T wave abnormality, with consideration of anterior ischemia. This indicates a Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1) according to the HEART score criteria.","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]

Type: ED Visit
Provider: Physician


Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.
