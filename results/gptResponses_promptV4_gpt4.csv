","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

""""""","The EKG interpretation provided in the notes indicates the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. According to the HEART score criteria, this falls under non-specific repolarization disturbance. Therefore, the EKG subscore for this patient is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:

""""""","The patient presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that has lasted for 3 hours. The pain is exertional and radiates to the left shoulder. The patient also reports shortness of breath that worsens when laying flat and mild diaphoresis. These symptoms are highly indicative of a myocardial infarction. [Highly suspicious (2)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Sinus Rhythm

Electronically Signed on 06-29-2023 14:25:51 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","The patient's history is highly suggestive of a myocardial infarction. He presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that has been ongoing for 3 hours, which radiates to his left arm. This chest pain is exertional in nature, a classic feature of angina. He also has associated shortness of breath that worsens when laying flat, and is mildly diaphoretic. These symptoms are all typical of myocardial ischemia. [Highly suspicious (2)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:

The pain also worsens when the patient is laying flat, which could suggest cardiac ischemia. Furthermore, the patient is diaphoretic, which is a common symptom in acute coronary syndromes.

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

""""""","The EKG interpretation provided in the notes shows that the patient has sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is no mention of significant ST-segment depressions or elevations. According to the HEART score criteria, typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy fall under the category of non-specific repolarization disturbance. Therefore, the patient's EKG subscore is: [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]

""""""","The patient's history is highly suggestive of a myocardial infarction. The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with severe left-sided chest pressure that has been ongoing for 3 hours. The pain is exertional, pressure-like, and radiates to the left shoulder. The patient also has associated shortness of breath that worsens when laying flat. These are classic symptoms of myocardial ischemia. The patient denies a history of acute coronary syndrome, but does not see a cardiologist regularly, which could suggest an undiagnosed or unmanaged heart condition. [Highly suspicious (2)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Urgent Visit: 

A 68-year-old gentleman with hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents for recurrence of shortness of breath. He first had symptoms 3 weeks ago. He was treated with antibiotics and finish antibiotic course on August 16th. He reports continued nasal congestion, cough, production of sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing and subjective fevers/chills. He also reports some headaches. No nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. 

BP 122/07 | Pulse (!) 90 | Temp 97.8 °F (36.6 °C) | Resp 20 | SpO2 98% 

In no acute distress lungs are clear to auscultation Regular heart rate and rhythm. The abdomen is soft and non distended Assessment plan: A 68-year-old gentleman with hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents for recurrence of nasal congestion. I am going to obtain a respiratory viral panel, sputum culture and chest x ray. I am concerned about a pneumonia. I will start antibiotics and call him back with his lab results.



""""""","The patient's risk factors can be assessed as follows:

- Currently treated diabetes mellitus: There is no mention of diabetes in the patient's notes, so this is a NO.
- Current or recent (<90 days) smoker: The patient is noted as a non-smoker in multiple notes, so this is a NO.
- Diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension (HTN) and is on medication for it, so this is a YES.
- Diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: The patient has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia (HLD), which is a form of high cholesterol, so this is a YES.
- Family history of coronary artery disease: The patient denies any family history of early cardiovascular disease, so this is a NO.
- Current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30): The patient's BMI is noted as being between 36.0-36.9, which is considered obese, so this is a YES.
- A history of significant atherosclerosis: The patient has no history of coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, so this is a NO.

The patient therefore has 3 risk factors: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. 

This leads to a risk factor subscore of: [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]","2","1","2",2,2,9

- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","The patient's history is highly suspicious for a myocardial infarction. He presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that has been ongoing for 3 hours. The pain is exertional, radiates to the left shoulder, and is associated with shortness of breath that worsens when laying flat. These are classic symptoms of myocardial ischemia. [Highly suspicious (2)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

""""""","The patient's history is highly suggestive of a myocardial infarction. He presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiates to his arm, which started approximately 3 hours prior to his arrival at the ED. The pain is described as pressure-like and exertional, and it worsens when the patient is lying flat. These are classic symptoms of angina pectoris, which is often a precursor to a myocardial infarction. The patient also reports shortness of breath, another common symptom of MI. Furthermore, the patient is diaphoretic, which is a common sign of acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, based on the patient's history, I would classify it as [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI).

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started 2 hours prior while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He describes the pain as sharp, more in the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. He denies any shortness of breath or radiation of pain. He has no personal or family history of heart problems. The nature of the pain, its location, and the fact that it started during physical exertion suggest that it might be musculoskeletal in origin, rather than cardiac. 

Therefore, based on the patient's history, the chest pain seems to be more related to a potential musculoskeletal issue rather than a typical myocardial infarction presentation.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He describes the pain as sharp and more localized to the shoulder than the chest. He denies any shortness of breath or radiation of pain. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems. The pain is also reproducible and tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff, suggesting a possible musculoskeletal etiology. Given these details, the patient's history is not typical of myocardial infarction.

Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He describes the pain as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. He denies any shortness of breath or radiation of pain. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems. The pain seems to be more related to physical exertion and is localized to the shoulder area, which is not typical of myocardial infarction. Therefore, the history is not highly suggestive of MI.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

The pain is also tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. There is no personal or family history of heart problems.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

However, there is no mention of significant ST-segment deviations, non-specific repolarization disturbances, bundle branch block, or left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore, the EKG subscore would be considered normal according to the HEART score criteria. [Normal (0)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Pt report 2 hr chest pain, used rowing machine before. R sided. No SOB. Hasn’t taken anything for pain. No hx MI.
HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He describes the pain as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. He has no shortness of breath, no radiation of pain, and no history of heart problems. The pain seems to be more related to physical exertion and is localized to a specific area that is tender to touch, suggesting a musculoskeletal cause rather than a cardiac one. 

Therefore, the history is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started two hours prior while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and there is tenderness to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. There is no history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. The patient denies any shortness of breath or radiation of pain. He has no personal or family history of heart problems. Given the patient's history, the chest pain seems to be more related to physical exertion and is localized to the right shoulder area. This presentation is not typical of myocardial infarction, which is usually associated with central chest pain, often radiating to the left arm or jaw, and triggered by exertion or stress.

You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes.

Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Type: ED Visit
Provider: Registered Nurse


04:15 PM 3/10 chest pain for last 2 hours after using rowing machine at gym. EKG done. NKA. MD aware
of chest pain, no new orders at this time.
05:35 PM Troponin <6. Lidocaine patch applied per MAR. Pt reports chest pain improved to 1/10. NAD.
Resting comfortably in stretcher with side rails up and call button in reach.
06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with
steady gait, wife coming to pick him up.



""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He describes the pain as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. He denies any shortness of breath or radiation of pain. He has no personal or family history of heart problems. The nature of the pain, its location, and the fact that it started during physical exertion suggest that it might be musculoskeletal in origin rather than cardiac. However, the presence of chest pain, even if it is more on the shoulder, cannot be completely ignored as a potential sign of myocardial infarction.

[Modestly suspicious (1)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. He describes the pain as sharp, more in the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. He denies any shortness of breath or radiation of pain. He has no personal or family history of heart problems. The pain seems to be more related to physical exertion and is localized to a specific area that is tender to touch, suggesting a musculoskeletal origin rather than a cardiac one.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:

There is no radiation of the pain and no associated shortness of breath. The patient has no personal or family history of heart problems.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

""""""","The EKG interpretation provided in the notes indicates a sinus rhythm and potential left atrial enlargement. There is no mention of significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, bundle branch block, or repolarization abnormalities. Therefore, the EKG is considered normal according to the Minnesota criteria. [Normal (0)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pt report 2 hr chest pain, used rowing machine before. R sided. No SOB. Hasn’t taken anything for pain. No hx MI.
HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and it does not radiate. The patient denies any shortness of breath. The pain is also tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff, suggesting a possible musculoskeletal origin. There is no personal or family history of heart problems. Given these details, the history is not highly suggestive of a typical myocardial infarction presentation.

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]

""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started 2 hours ago while using a rowing machine at the gym. He describes the pain as sharp, located more in the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. He has no history of heart problems and no family history of myocardial infarction. He denies shortness of breath and radiation of pain. The pain is not typical of angina, as it is right-sided, sharp, and associated with physical exertion. The pain also seems to be related to a possible musculoskeletal issue, as it is tender to palpation and started during physical exercise.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Last Edited: 2023-07-14 17:37:00
Type: ED Visit
Provider: Registered Nurse


04:15 PM 3/10 chest pain for last 2 hours after using rowing machine at gym. EKG done. NKA. MD aware
of chest pain, no new orders at this time.
05:35 PM Troponin <6. Lidocaine patch applied per MAR. Pt reports chest pain improved to 1/10. NAD.
Resting comfortably in stretcher with side rails up and call button in reach.
06:15 PM Discharge instructions reviewed with pt by MD. IV removed. Ambulatory to waiting room with
steady gait, wife coming to pick him up.



""""""","The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with right-sided chest pain that started while he was using a rowing machine at the gym. The pain is described as sharp, more on the shoulder than the chest, and it is tender to palpation over the right anterior rotator cuff. There is no history of similar pain or heart problems, and no family history of myocardial infarction. The patient denies shortness of breath and radiation of pain. Given these details, the chest pain seems more likely to be related to a musculoskeletal issue rather than a cardiac event, as it is localized, right-sided, and associated with physical exertion. 

Therefore, the history is [Slightly suspicious (0)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

The patient denies any shortness of breath or radiation of pain. There is no personal or family history of heart problems.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
Consider left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 07-14-2023 16:07:32 EDT by



""""""","The EKG interpretation mentions sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. There is no mention of significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, bundle branch block, or left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore, the EKG can be considered normal according to the HEART score criteria. [Normal (0)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:

MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

personally performed medically appropriate history and physical exam and the MDM:
On my exam:
Comfortable in NAD with reproducible TTP over R shoulder and chest wall. NRR, CTAB.
My differential includes:
Considered but doubt ACS. Low risk for PE. Doubt fracture, no significant trauma. Favor mild sprain of
shoulder but cannot exclude more serious rotator cuff injury. Would recommend close follow-up with
PMD as may need MRI and ortho or sports ref if symptoms persist.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast, radiates to her neck, and worsens with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea. These symptoms are typical of myocardial infarction, especially the chest pain radiating to the neck and the associated nausea. However, the pain is described as sharp and worsens with deep respirations, which is not typical for MI as MI pain is usually described as pressure-like and not affected by respiration. Therefore, the history contains both traditional and non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.

- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast and radiates to her neck. The pain is described as sharp and worsens with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea but denies vomiting. These symptoms are typical of myocardial infarction, especially the chest pain radiating to the neck and the associated nausea. However, the patient also reports that the pain is pleuritic in nature, which is not typical of myocardial infarction. The patient denies any known history of coronary artery disease and there are no records of stress testing in the EMR. 

Given the presence of some traditional features of typical MI presentation (chest pain radiating to the neck, associated nausea) but also some atypical features (pleuritic nature of the pain), the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction.

[ Moderately suspicious (1) ]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of

radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman who presented with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast and radiates to her neck.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.



""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started in the morning after breakfast. The pain is described as sharp, worsens with deep respirations, and radiates to the neck. She also reports mild nausea but denies vomiting. The patient has no known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and does not believe she has ever had a stress test. She denies any new medications, recreational drug use, and systemic infectious symptoms. However, she was noted to be tachypneic on exam. These symptoms are indicative of a potential myocardial infarction, but the pleuritic nature of the pain and the absence of a history of CAD make the history moderately suspicious for MI.

Therefore, the patient's history subscore is [Moderately suspicious (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was

radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited

12:24 PM 54F with several hours of left sided chest pain. Radiates to neck. +pleuritic. Reports several of
her family have had PEs in the past but doesn’t think she has had one. No cough, fever, SOB. No hx MI.
Received aspirin and EKG at triage. Labs/IV. Placed on monitor, side rails in place, call bell in reach.
01:03 PM Chest pain still persistent 5/10, MD aware, nitroglycerin administered per MAR.
01:25 PM Patient reports continued chest pain 4/10, MD notified no new orders at this time.
02:41 PM Chest pain is now resolved. No other new or worsening symptoms.
03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.



""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman who presented with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast. The pain is described as sharp, worsens with deep breaths, and radiates to her neck. She also reports mild nausea but no vomiting. These symptoms are typical of myocardial infarction, especially the radiation of pain to the neck and the associated nausea. However, the patient's pain is also pleuritic in nature, which is not typical for MI. Pleuritic chest pain is usually associated with conditions that affect the pleura, such as pulmonary embolism or pneumonia. The patient denies any known history of coronary artery disease and no records of stress testing are noted in the EMR. Given the mixed nature of her symptoms, her history is moderately suspicious for MI.

[ Moderately suspicious (1) ]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

S: 54 yo presents for problem visit
Pt reporting that over the past month, she has had significant pain in her soles first thing in the morning.
She says that with her leg pain, it has been very difficult to walk much and she has been staying in bed or
on the couch more. She noticed that over the past month, when she first stands in the morning, her
bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast and radiates to her neck.

She denies any known history of CAD and no records of stress testing are noted in our EMR. These symptoms are typical of myocardial infarction, with the pain being localized, radiating, and associated with nausea. However, the pain is pleuritic in nature, which is not typical for MI.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Type: ED Visit
Provider: Physician


Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman who presented with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast and radiates to her neck. The pain is described as sharp and worsens with deep breaths. She also reports mild nausea but no vomiting. These symptoms are suggestive of typical angina, which is a common presentation of myocardial infarction. Therefore, the patient's history is highly suspicious for myocardial infarction.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started in the morning after breakfast. The pain is described as sharp, worsens with deep respirations, and radiates to her neck. She also reports mild nausea but no vomiting. These symptoms are somewhat typical for myocardial infarction, with the pain being localized, sharp, and radiating. However, the pain worsening with deep respirations (pleuritic chest pain) is not a typical feature of MI. The patient also denies any known history of coronary artery disease and there are no records of stress testing in the EMR. 

Based on the above information, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction. It contains some traditional elements of typical MI presentation (localized, sharp, radiating chest pain, and nausea), but also some non-traditional elements (pleuritic chest pain).

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast and radiates to her neck. The pain is described as sharp and worsens with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea but denies vomiting. These symptoms are somewhat typical of myocardial infarction, especially the left-sided chest pain radiating to the neck and the associated nausea. However, the patient also describes the pain as pleuritic (worsening with deep breaths), which is not a typical feature of MI. The patient denies any known history of coronary artery disease and there are no records of previous stress testing in the EMR. 

Given these factors, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction. It contains some traditional elements of typical MI presentation (left-sided chest pain radiating to the neck, nausea) but also includes non-traditional elements (pleuritic pain).

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:

""""""","The patient's EKG shows a left bundle branch block, which falls under the category of non-specific repolarization disturbance according to the HEART score criteria. Therefore, the EKG subscore for this patient is: [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

The patient denies any known history of coronary artery disease and there are no records of stress testing in the EMR. 

Based on this information, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for a myocardial infarction. The chest pain and its radiation to the neck, along with the nausea, are concerning for MI. However, the pleuritic nature of the pain and the absence of a personal history of CAD make the history less typical for MI. 

[ Moderately suspicious (1) ]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started in the morning after breakfast. The pain is described as sharp, radiating to her neck, and worsening with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea. These symptoms are suggestive of angina, which is a common presentation of myocardial infarction. However, the patient also has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism and the pain is pleuritic in nature, which is not typical for MI. Therefore, the history contains both traditional and non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.



""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast and radiates to her neck. The pain is described as sharp and worsens with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea but denies vomiting. The patient does not have a known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or any previous stress tests. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism but does not have a personal history of thromboembolic disease. The patient denies any new medications, recreational drug use, fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. However, she was noted to be tachypneic on exam. This history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction, as the patient presents with chest pain that radiates to the neck, worsens with deep respirations, and is associated with nausea. These are non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation. [Moderately suspicious (1)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started in the morning after breakfast. The pain is described as sharp, radiates to the neck, and worsens with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea but denies vomiting. The patient's pain pattern, including its location and radiation, is suggestive of a potential cardiac origin. However, the pain is also described as pleuritic, which is not typical for myocardial infarction. The patient denies any known history of coronary artery disease and no records of stress testing are noted in the EMR. She denies any new medications, recreational drug use including cocaine, and systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was noted to be tachypneic on exam. 

Given the mixed elements in the patient's history, with some features suggestive of a myocardial infarction and others not, the history is moderately suspicious for a myocardial infarction.

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Possible left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started after breakfast and radiates to her neck. The pain is described as sharp and worsens with deep respirations. She also reports mild nausea but no vomiting. The patient denies any known history of coronary artery disease and does not believe she has ever had a stress test. She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism but denies any personal history of thromboembolic disease. The patient's chest pain is not typical of angina as it is pleuritic and worsens with deep respirations. However, the radiation to the neck and associated nausea are concerning for possible myocardial ischemia. 

Given these factors, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for a myocardial infarction. [Moderately suspicious (1)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:

on the couch more. She noticed that over the past month, when she first stands in the morning, her
bilateral soles “hurt like burning” and often she has to sit back down. She stats that “it feels like my feet
are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

""""""","The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with left-sided chest pain that started in the morning after breakfast. The pain is described as sharp, worsens with deep respirations, and radiates to her neck. She also reports some mild nausea. These symptoms are suggestive of angina, which can be a symptom of myocardial infarction. The patient's pain is localized and has a clear trigger (after eating), which is typical of angina. The radiation of the pain to the neck is also a common feature in myocardial infarction. However, the pain worsening with deep respirations is more indicative of a pleuritic cause, which is not typical for myocardial infarction. The patient does not have a known history of coronary artery disease and there are no records of previous stress testing. 

Based on the above, the patient's history is moderately suspicious for myocardial infarction. It contains some traditional elements of typical MI presentation such as localized chest pain that radiates to the neck and is associated with nausea, but also includes non-traditional elements such as pleuritic chest pain.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes.

Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Therefore, the EKG subscore for this patient is [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current and previous visits below, delimited by triple quotes.

Consider the following specific risk factors:
- currently treated diabetes mellitus,
- current or recent (<90 days) smoker,
- diagnosed and/or treated hypertension,
- diagnosed hypercholesterolemia,
- family history of coronary artery disease,
- current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30), or
- a history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease)

Step 1) For the patient notes below, across all the combined encounter notes (but not including new diagnoses resulting from the current visit, how many of the specific risk factors from the list above are present for the patient? Tally with a YES or NO as you go through each risk factor on the list.

Step 2) Please determine the patient's risk factor subscore (one component of the overall HEART score).
Choose between these options in brackets: [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or any history of atherosclerotic disease (2)]

If there is not enough information provided in the notes to determine a risk factor subscore, please choose:
[Not enough information]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [No known risk factors (0)]

Provider: Physician


Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes.

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Provider: Registered Nurse


09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.



""""""","The patient is a 38-year-old woman who presented with 8/10 chest pain that started about an hour ago and has been continuous since then. The pain is described as pressure-like, as if ""someone is sitting on my chest"". The pain radiates to her left shoulder and neck. She also reports associated nausea and exertional dyspnea when climbing stairs for the last few weeks. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, which have been increasing in frequency. This history is highly suggestive of a typical myocardial infarction presentation. 

Therefore, the history subscore is [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:

     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.



""""""","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with chest pain that started about an hour ago. She describes the pain as pressure-like, as if ""someone is sitting on my chest"". The pain radiates to her left shoulder and neck. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, which have been increasing in frequency. She also reports exertional dyspnea when climbing stairs for the past few weeks. These symptoms are typical of myocardial infarction, making the history highly suspicious. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN
Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care



""""""","The patient's risk factors are as follows:

- Currently treated diabetes mellitus: There is no mention of the patient being treated for diabetes mellitus. NO
- Current or recent (<90 days) smoker: There is no mention of the patient being a current or recent smoker. NO
- Diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: There is no mention of the patient being diagnosed or treated for hypertension. NO

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes.

no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.

     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

Provider: Registered Nurse


09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.



""""""","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with 8/10 chest pain that is pressure-like and radiating to her left shoulder and neck. She describes the pain as if ""someone is sitting on my chest."" The pain started about an hour ago while she was making breakfast and has been continuous since then. She also reports associated nausea and exertional dyspnea when climbing stairs for the last few weeks. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, which have been increasing in frequency. This history is highly suggestive of typical myocardial infarction presentation, with symptoms such as chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, pressure-like chest pain, and associated symptoms such as nausea and exertional dyspnea. 

[Highly suspicious (2)]","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes.

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN
Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care



""""""","The patient's risk factors are evaluated as follows:

- Currently treated diabetes mellitus: There is no mention of diabetes in the patient's history, so this is a NO.
- Current or recent (<90 days) smoker: The patient's notes do not mention any history of smoking, so this is a NO.
- Diagnosed and/or treated hypertension: There is no mention of hypertension in the patient's history, so this is a NO.
- Diagnosed hypercholesterolemia: There is no mention of hypercholesterolemia in the patient's history, so this is a NO.
- Family history of coronary artery disease: The patient's mother had a heart attack at 42 and her father died suddenly at 50, which could be suggestive of coronary artery disease. This is a YES.
- Current obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30): The patient's weight is recorded as 65.7 kg and 72.4 kg in different notes, but without the patient's height, we cannot calculate the BMI. This is a NO due to lack of information.
- A history of significant atherosclerosis (coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, irrespective of the risk factors for coronary artery disease): The patient has no personal history of these conditions, so this is a NO.

The patient has 1 risk factor from the list above, which is a family history of coronary artery disease. Therefore, the patient's risk factor subscore is [1-2 risk factors (1)].","2","2","1",0,2,7

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with chest pain that she describes as pressure-like, similar to ""someone sitting on my chest."" The pain started an hour ago while she was making breakfast and has been continuous since then. The pain radiates to her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, which have been increasing in frequency. She also had trouble sleeping due to the pain and has been experiencing exertional dyspnea when climbing stairs for the last few weeks. These symptoms are highly suggestive of a typical myocardial infarction presentation.

Therefore, the history subscore is [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

her garden a lot, and noticed that her abrasion is not healing. She thinks that it is getting larger, redder
and more painful. Has been putting some antibiotic ointment on it and wrapping it tightly, thinks that is is
now also oozing. Denies trying any medications for it. Has not had anything like this before.
- no fevers at home
- has with some palpitations at baseline due to anxiety
- denies lighteadeness or dizziness
- denies falls
C/f cellulitis

today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further

Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be

For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. Considering the patient's symptoms and presentation (exclusively considering the patient's HPI paragraph, and ignoring the risk factors, ECGs, laboratory results and any later developments), please determine the patient's history subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Slightly suspicious (0)] [Moderately suspicious (1)] [Highly suspicious (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Slightly suspicious (0)] for nonspecific history lacking clear chest pain patterns, triggers, localization, related symptoms, and/or reactions to sublingual nitrates.
- Choose [Moderately suspicious (1)] for moderately suspicious history that contains traditional & non-traditional elements of typical MI presentation.
- Choose [Highly suspicious (2)] for highly suspicious history mainly comprising traditional features of typical MI presentation.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient history is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt history not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning, then conclude with your answer in brackets by choosing between the options above, e.g., [Slightly suspicious (0)]

""""""","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with continuous, pressure-like chest pain that started about an hour ago. The pain is described as ""someone sitting on my chest"" and radiates to her left shoulder and neck. She has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, which have been increasing in frequency. She also reports exertional dyspnea when climbing stairs for the last few weeks. These symptoms are highly suggestive of typical MI presentation. 

Therefore, the history subscore is [Highly suspicious (2)].","CONTEXT: You are a cardiologist consulted by the Emergency Department for a patient with a potential myocardial infarction (MI). The HEART score is applied to determine the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and to help decide between admitting or discharging the patient. Please be concise in your answers.

PROMPT:
You will be given clinical encounter notes relevant to the patient's current visit below, delimited by triple quotes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) reading for the patient should be present in one of the notes below. Considering the patient's EKG,  please determine the patient's EKG subscore (one component of the overall HEART score). 

Choose between these options in brackets: [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] 
For clarity on scoring:
- Choose [Normal (0)] if the EKG is 'normal' according to Minnesota criteria or if none of the specific criteria in the following choices are met.
- Choose [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] for:
     - Repolarization abnormalities without significant ST-segment depression.
     - Presence of a bundle branch block.
     - Typical abnormalities indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (not counting isolated left atrial hypertrophy).
     - Repolarization abnormalities likely due to the use of digoxin or unchanged known repolarization disturbances.
- Choose [Significant ST deviation (2)] for significant ST-segment depressions or elevations, unless these are seen in the context of a bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or the use of digoxin.

If there is not enough information provided in the notes, or if the patient EKG interpretation is altogether not provided, please choose:
[Not enough information - Pt EKG interpretation not present]


Use this format for your response: First explain your reasoning. Conclude by picking, without alteration, one of the bracketed choices above. An example end to your response would be: [Normal (0)]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# RLE wound
1 week ago, the patient scratched her shin and obtained an small abrasion. She has since been working in
her garden a lot, and noticed that her abrasion is not healing. She thinks that it is getting larger, redder
and more painful. Has been putting some antibiotic ointment on it and wrapping it tightly, thinks that is is
now also oozing. Denies trying any medications for it. Has not had anything like this before.
- no fevers at home
- has with some palpitations at baseline due to anxiety
- denies lighteadeness or dizziness
- denies falls
C/f cellulitis
Start antibiotics with doxy and Keflex
F/u 1 week
If not improving, go the ED

ASSESSMENT/PLAN
Sofia Rodriquez-Colon is a 38 y.o. female with past medical history significant for anxiety who presents
today for urgent visit.
# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.
