","Based on the patient's symptoms of severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to the arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, along with their past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease, there is a moderate suspicion for a cardiac event such as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The initial troponin level was markedly elevated, and the ECG showed some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Cardiology was consulted and recommended serial troponin/ECG and admission. The patient's chest pain improved after medication and they were admitted to the telemetry unit. Therefore, the patient's history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiates to the arm, associated with shortness of breath.
- The chest pain started approximately 3 hours ago and is pressure-like and exertional. It worsens when laying flat.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and family history of early cardiovascular disease.
- Initial troponin levels are markedly elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.
- The ECG shows some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
- Cardiology consult recommends serial troponin/ECG and admission, indicating a high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient's symptoms and risk factors, along with the elevated troponin, support a highly suspicious history for cardiac involvement.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

- The chest pain started approximately 3 hours ago and is pressure-like and exertional.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and family history of early cardiovascular disease.
- There are no documented risk factors for DVT/PE, recent surgery, immobilization, or hormone use.
- Initial troponin levels are markedly elevated, and the ECG shows some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
- Cardiology consultation recommends serial troponin/ECG and admission.
- The patient's symptoms and risk factors raise a high clinical suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and family history of early cardiovascular disease.
- The initial troponin level is markedly elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.
- The ECG shows some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
- Cardiology consult recommends serial troponin/ECG and admission, indicating a high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient is admitted for further evaluation and management.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiates to the arm, associated with shortness of breath.
- The chest pain started approximately 3 hours ago and is pressure-like and exertional.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and family history of early cardiovascular disease.
- Initial troponin levels are markedly elevated, and the ECG shows some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
- Cardiology consult recommends serial troponin/ECG and admission.
- The patient's symptoms and risk factors raise concerns for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient's physical exam shows elevated blood pressure and heart rate.
- The patient is admitted for further evaluation and management.

Based on the information provided, the patient's history is highly suspicious for ACS.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is no mention of ST deviation or any other specific repolarization changes. Therefore, the EKG score would be [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

","Based on the patient's symptoms of severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to the arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, along with their past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease, there is a high suspicion for a cardiac event such as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The initial troponin level was markedly elevated, further supporting this suspicion. The patient's ECG showed some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which can be a sign of underlying heart disease. Cardiology was consulted and recommended serial troponin/ECG and admission, indicating a high level of concern. Therefore, the patient's history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)] based on the following reasons:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiates to the arm, associated with shortness of breath.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) but reports exertional chest pain that worsens when laying flat.
- The initial troponin level is markedly elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.
- The ECG shows some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
- Cardiology is consulted and recommends serial troponin/ECG and admission, indicating a high level of concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient is admitted for further evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient's symptoms, risk factors, and diagnostic findings suggest a high suspicion for ACS, warranting further investigation and treatment.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presents with severe left-sided chest pressure that radiates to the arm, associated with shortness of breath.
- The patient denies a history of myocardial infarction (MI) but reports exertional chest pain that worsens when laying flat.
- Initial troponin levels are markedly elevated, and the ECG shows some left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
- Cardiology is consulted and recommends serial troponin/ECG and admission.
- The patient's symptoms and risk factors raise concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient is admitted for further evaluation and management.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

","Based on the patient's symptoms of severe left-sided chest pressure radiating to the arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, along with their past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease, there is a high suspicion for cardiac-related issues such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The initial troponin level was markedly elevated, supporting this suspicion. The patient's physical exam findings of elevated blood pressure and heart rate further contribute to the suspicion. The patient has been admitted to the telemetry unit for further evaluation and management.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain, which is a concerning symptom for potential cardiac issues.
- The pain started after using a rowing machine, which could potentially be a trigger for cardiac symptoms.
- The pain is described as sharp and located on the right side, with more shoulder involvement than chest.
- The patient has no history of myocardial infarction (MI) but does have tenderness over the right anterior rotator cuff.
- The EKG is non-ischemic without ST segment changes, but troponin levels are still pending.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal limits.
- The patient is discharged with a diagnosis of unspecified chest pain, but close follow-up with a primary care physician (PMD) is recommended if symptoms persist.

Overall, the patient's history raises concerns for potential cardiac involvement, and further evaluation and monitoring are warranted.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

","Based on the provided information, the EKG interpretation shows sinus rhythm and the consideration of left atrial enlargement. There is no mention of ST deviation or any specific repolarization disturbance. Therefore, there is not enough information to determine the EKG score. [Not enough information to determine EKG score]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

Patient Reevaluation: ED Attestation: PA/APRN
Face to face evaluation was performed by me in collaboration with the Advanced Practice Provider to
assess for significant health threats. I provided a substantive portion of the care of this patient. I
personally performed medically appropriate history and physical exam and the MDM:
On my exam:
Comfortable in NAD with reproducible TTP over R shoulder and chest wall. NRR, CTAB.
My differential includes:
Considered but doubt ACS. Low risk for PE. Doubt fracture, no significant trauma. Favor mild sprain of
shoulder but cannot exclude more serious rotator cuff injury. Would recommend close follow-up with
PMD as may need MRI and ortho or sports ref if symptoms persist.

Pt report 2 hr chest pain, used rowing machine before. R sided. No SOB. Hasn’t taken anything for pain. No hx MI.
HPI/PE:
Patient is a 50M w/ no sig PMH here w/ CP.
He reports pain started about 2 hours ago. At the time he was at the gym using a rowing machine
because his PCP has been getting him to lose weight. Reports losing 10 pounds over the last 2 months,
no longer overweight. Denies shortness of breath. Denies radiation of pain.
Describes pain as sharp, R sided, more shoulder than chest.
No history of prior shoulder injuries or rotator cuff injuries. Tender to palpation over the R anterior
rotator cuff.
No personal history of heart problems. No one in his family has had an MI.
MDM:
50M here w/ CP suspected to be mechanical in etiology. Considered ACS, however EKG non-ischemic
without any ST segment changes. Will get troponin and reassess. Doubt DVT/PE
Low suspicion for shoulder fracture or other emergent MSK process. May be related to rotator cuff
injury, however no emergent treatment would be indicated. Will try lidocaine patch and advice RICE for
now and have him follow up with PMD if his shoulder pain doesn’t get better.

is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, which is concerning for a cardiac etiology.
- The pain is described as pleuritic and radiating to the neck, which can be associated with cardiac causes.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- There is a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises concern for potential thrombotic events.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be indicative of underlying cardiac pathology.
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated, which can suggest cardiac injury.
- The patient's symptoms improved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which are commonly used for cardiac-related chest pain.
- The patient is being referred to a chest pain center for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Therefore, the EKG score would be [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

12:24 PM 54F with several hours of left sided chest pain. Radiates to neck. +pleuritic. Reports several of
her family have had PEs in the past but doesn’t think she has had one. No cough, fever, SOB. No hx MI.
Received aspirin and EKG at triage. Labs/IV. Placed on monitor, side rails in place, call bell in reach.
01:03 PM Chest pain still persistent 5/10, MD aware, nitroglycerin administered per MAR.
01:25 PM Patient reports continued chest pain 4/10, MD notified no new orders at this time.
02:41 PM Chest pain is now resolved. No other new or worsening symptoms.
03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.


","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning:
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, is localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates into the neck. The pain worsens with deep respirations and is pleuritic. These characteristics are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises concern for potential thrombotic events.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be associated with cardiac ischemia.
- The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which are commonly used in the management of cardiac chest pain.
- Cardiology has recommended expedited stress testing for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Overall, the patient's history, symptoms, and past medical conditions raise a high suspicion for cardiac involvement.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by


","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and possible left atrial enlargement. Left bundle branch block is considered a non-specific repolarization disturbance, and therefore would be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious for a cardiac etiology of their chest pain. They have a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, and although a d-dimer was obtained and found to be within normal range, a PE cannot be completely ruled out. The patient also has a history of peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the patient's ECG showed a new left bundle branch block and troponin levels were mildly elevated. The chest pain resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, further supporting a cardiac etiology. Therefore, the patient's history is [Highly suspicious (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Type: ED Visit
Provider: Registered Nurse


12:24 PM 54F with several hours of left sided chest pain. Radiates to neck. +pleuritic. Reports several of
her family have had PEs in the past but doesn’t think she has had one. No cough, fever, SOB. No hx MI.
Received aspirin and EKG at triage. Labs/IV. Placed on monitor, side rails in place, call bell in reach.
01:03 PM Chest pain still persistent 5/10, MD aware, nitroglycerin administered per MAR.
01:25 PM Patient reports continued chest pain 4/10, MD notified no new orders at this time.
02:41 PM Chest pain is now resolved. No other new or worsening symptoms.
03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.


","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, is localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates into the neck. The pain worsens with deep respirations and is pleuritic. These characteristics are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises concern for thromboembolic disease.
- The patient denies OCP use, recent surgery, long-distance travel, or trauma, which makes other potential causes less likely.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be associated with cardiac pathology.
- The patient's troponin level is mildly elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which can be indicative of ischemic etiology.
- Cardiology has recommended expedited stress testing for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and possible left atrial enlargement. Left bundle branch block is considered a non-specific repolarization disturbance, which earns 1 point. Therefore, the EKG score would be [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

are on fire and tearing up”, very discouraged as her “legs hurt with walking and feet hurt with standing”.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient has a chief complaint of chest pain, which is a concerning symptom.
- The pain is described as starting after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest, and radiating into the neck. It worsens with deep respirations and is pleuritic in nature.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which increases the suspicion for a potential thrombotic event.
- The patient denies known history of CAD but has peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be indicative of underlying cardiac pathology.
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated but stable, which can be a sign of cardiac injury.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, but further evaluation is recommended.
- The patient will be admitted to the chest pain center for stress testing, indicating a high level of suspicion for cardiac etiology of the chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is moderately suspicious (1). 

Reasoning: 
- The patient's chief complaint of chest pain, which started after breakfast and is localized to the left side of the chest, is concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The pain is described as pleuritic, sharp, and worsens with deep respirations, which can be associated with cardiac causes.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises suspicion for potential thrombotic events.
- The patient has a history of peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be indicative of underlying cardiac pathology.
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated, further supporting a cardiac etiology.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which can be consistent with ischemic etiologies.
- The patient is being referred for expedited stress testing to evaluate for potential ischemic causes of chest pain.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, is localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates into the neck. The pain is pleuritic and worsens with deep respirations. These characteristics are consistent with cardiac chest pain.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, which are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises concern for potential thrombotic events.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be associated with cardiac ischemia.
- The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which are commonly used to treat cardiac chest pain.
- The patient is being referred to a chest pain center for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Based on this information, the patient's history is highly suspicious for cardiac-related chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder.
- The patient denies known history of CAD but has not had a stress test.
- The patient has a new left bundle branch block on ECG and mildly elevated troponin.
- The patient's chest pain resolved with aspirin/nitro, but expedited stress testing is recommended for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

12:24 PM 54F with several hours of left sided chest pain. Radiates to neck. +pleuritic. Reports several of
her family have had PEs in the past but doesn’t think she has had one. No cough, fever, SOB. No hx MI.
Received aspirin and EKG at triage. Labs/IV. Placed on monitor, side rails in place, call bell in reach.
01:03 PM Chest pain still persistent 5/10, MD aware, nitroglycerin administered per MAR.
01:25 PM Patient reports continued chest pain 4/10, MD notified no new orders at this time.
02:41 PM Chest pain is now resolved. No other new or worsening symptoms.
03:45 PM Per d/w MD patient will be admitted to chest pain center for stress test tomorrow. Handover
provided to CPC RN.
04:05 PM Patient transported to CPC further care deferred to CPC RN.


","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, is localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates into the neck. The pain is pleuritic and worsens with deep respirations. These characteristics are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which increases the suspicion for thromboembolic disease.
- The patient has a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be associated with cardiac ischemia.
- The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which are commonly used for cardiac chest pain.
- The patient is being referred to a chest pain center for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and possible left atrial enlargement. Left bundle branch block is considered a non-specific repolarization disturbance, so the EKG score would be [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","Based on the patient's symptoms and past medical conditions, the history is [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, is localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates into the neck. The pain is pleuritic and worsens with deep respirations. These characteristics are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient denies a known history of CAD but has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises suspicion for potential thrombotic events.
- The ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be associated with cardiac conditions.
- The troponin level is mildly elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which are commonly used for cardiac-related chest pain.
- Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited stress testing, further supporting the suspicion of a cardiac etiology.

Therefore, the history is highly suspicious (2).","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),

A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block.
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated but stable.
- The patient was tachypneic on exam.
- The patient's chest pain resolved with aspirin/nitro, but stress testing was recommended for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates into the neck. The pain is pleuritic and worsens with deep respirations. These characteristics are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises concern for potential thrombotic events.
- The patient denies known history of CAD, but there is uncertainty regarding prior stress testing.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be associated with cardiac pathology.
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated but stable, which may indicate cardiac injury.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin/nitro, but further evaluation is recommended for potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning:
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, is localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates into the neck. The pain worsens with deep respirations and is pleuritic.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder.
- The patient denies known history of coronary artery disease but has not had a stress test.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block.
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated but stable.
- The patient's chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro.
- Cardiology has recommended expedited stress testing for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Left bundle branch block
Possible left atrial enlargement
Electronically Signed on 08-01-2023 12:05:34 EDT by


","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and possible left atrial enlargement. Left bundle branch block is considered a non-specific repolarization disturbance and is worth 1 point. Therefore, the EKG score would be [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast, is localized to the left side of the chest, and radiates to the neck. The pain is pleuritic and worsens with deep respirations. These characteristics are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, which are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises concern for potential thrombotic events.
- The patient denies known history of CAD, but there is no documentation of a stress test to rule out coronary artery disease.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which is a concerning finding.
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which may suggest an ischemic etiology.
- The patient is tachypneic on exam, which may indicate respiratory distress.
- The patient's chest radiography does not show evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
- The patient will be referred to a chest pain center for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

- The patient's chest pain is pleuritic and worsens with deep respirations, which can be indicative of a pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be a sign of underlying cardiac pathology.
- The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, suggesting possible myocardial injury.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which increases the suspicion for a potential thromboembolic event.
- The patient's chest pain is pleuritic, which can be a symptom of pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be indicative of underlying cardiac pathology.
- The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, which can suggest myocardial damage.
- The patient's symptoms improved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which are commonly used in the management of cardiac ischemia.
- The patient is being referred for expedited stress testing to further evaluate potential ischemic etiologies.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has sinus rhythm and left bundle branch block. Left atrial enlargement is also possible. There is no mention of ST deviation or any other specific repolarization changes. Therefore, the EKG score would be categorized as [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning:
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast and is localized to the left side of the chest, radiating into the neck. The pain worsens with deep respirations and is pleuritic, which raises suspicion for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which raises concern for potential thromboembolic disease.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be associated with cardiac pathology.
- The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury.
- The patient's chest pain resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which are commonly used in the management of cardiac-related chest pain.
- Cardiology consultation was recommended for expedited stress testing to evaluate for potential ischemic etiologies.

Based on the above information, the patient's history is highly suspicious for cardiac pathology.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and possible left atrial enlargement. Left bundle branch block is considered a non-specific repolarization disturbance, so it would contribute 1 point to the EKG score. Therefore, the EKG score would be [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Pain started after breakfast about 9am, L sided, +pleuritic, no hx PE but thinks family hx. No fevers/infectious.
EKG+aspirin given
HPI/PE:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
Mrs. presents to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She reports that her chest
pain started this morning shortly after finishing her breakfast. The chest pain localizes to the left side of
her chest and radiates into her neck. She denies radiation to the back. Describes as sharp. Worsens with
deep respirations. Some mild nausea, though denies vomiting.
She denies any known history of CAD. She does not believe she has ever had a stress test and no records
of stress testing are noted in our EMR.
She has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism. She does not have a personal history of
thromboembolic disease, though there was a question of a potential primary thrombotic episode
precipitating a prior episode of limb ischemia, though she was not able to further clarify. She denies OCP
use, recent surgery, long distance travel, or trauma. She has not had any unilateral leg swelling or pain.
She denies hemoptysis.
She denies any new medications.
She denies recreational drug use including cocaine.
No fevers, chills, or systemic infectious symptoms. She initially denied shortness of breath though was
noted to be tachypneic on exam.
MDM:
is a 54 y/o woman with past medical history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II),
tobacco use disorder (2+ PPD) presenting for evaluation of chest pain.
A broad differential was considered for the etiology of her chest pain. Given her strong family history of
pulmonary embolism, this was a strong possibility, and a d-dimer was obtained to further assess and was
found to be within normal range. For this reason, PE is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. Chest
radiography was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Considered other infectious etiologies given her pleuritic chest pain, however she has had no fevers or
cough making this less likely. Her ECG was noted to show a new left bundle branch block of unclear
chronicity. Troponin mildly elevated but stable. Cardiology was consulted and recommended expedited
stress testing. Given chest pain has resolved with aspirin/nitro, will refer to chest pain center for further
evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that started after breakfast and is localized to the left side of the chest, radiating into the neck. The pain worsens with deep respirations and is described as sharp. These characteristics are concerning for cardiac origin.
- The patient has a strong family history of pulmonary embolism, which increases the suspicion for thromboembolic disease.
- The patient has a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (type II), and tobacco use disorder, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient's ECG shows a new left bundle branch block, which can be indicative of underlying cardiac pathology.
- The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, further raising concern for cardiac involvement.
- The patient's symptoms have resolved with aspirin and nitroglycerin, which can be consistent with ischemic etiologies.
- The patient is being referred to a chest pain center for further evaluation of potential ischemic etiologies.

Based on these findings, the patient's history is highly suspicious for cardiac involvement.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","Based on the patient's history, symptoms, and past medical conditions, the history can be rated as [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning:
- The patient's chief complaint of chest pain, described as pressure-like and radiating to the left shoulder and neck, is concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency, and had trouble sleeping due to pain.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death, which increases the suspicion for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has been experiencing exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks, which can be a symptom of cardiac dysfunction.
- The patient's ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding for cardiac ischemia.
- The initial troponin level was elevated, further supporting the suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient's symptoms resolved and pain is not currently present, but given the history and abnormal findings, further cardiac workup and admission are planned.

Therefore, the history is rated as [Highly suspicious (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Provider: Registered Nurse


09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","Based on the patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, along with the pressure-like sensation and associated nausea, and the fact that the pain has been continuous for an hour, the patient's history is highly suspicious for a cardiac event. Additionally, the patient's family history of a heart attack and sudden death, along with the abnormal ECG showing T-wave inversions, further increase suspicion. The elevated troponin levels and plan for admission for further cardiac workup support this suspicion. [Highly suspicious (2)]","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Sinus rhythm
ST & T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia
Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has ST and T wave abnormality, which raises concern for anterior ischemia. This indicates a significant ST deviation (2).","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has been continuous for about an hour. This is concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death, which raises the suspicion for underlying cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has never seen a cardiologist and has no prior stress testing.
- The EMS EKG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding.
- The initial troponin was elevated and declining, indicating possible myocardial injury.
- The patient has been admitted for further cardiac workup.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been

no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when

She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has been continuous for about an hour. This is concerning for cardiac origin.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death at relatively young ages.
- The patient has never seen a cardiologist and has no prior stress testing.
- The ECG performed by EMS shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding.
- The initial troponin level was elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury.
- The patient has been admitted for further cardiac workup.

Overall, the combination of symptoms, family history, abnormal ECG findings, and elevated troponin level raises a high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the etiology of the chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]

presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.

have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has had multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days. She also reports increasing frequency of exertional dyspnea. The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death. The ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads. Troponin levels are elevated. Considering these symptoms, risk factors, and abnormal findings, there is a high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the etiology of the chest pain. The patient is being admitted for further cardiac workup.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has ST & T wave abnormality, which raises concern for anterior ischemia. This indicates a significant ST deviation (2 points) as it is not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin. Therefore, the categorization would be [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]

# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care


","Based on the information provided, the patient has the following risk factors:

1. Positive family history (parent had a heart attack at 42)
2. Chest pain (possible ACS)
3. Abnormal ECG (T-wave inversions)
4. Elevated troponin levels (indicative of NSTEMI)

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has been continuous for over an hour.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death at relatively young ages.
- The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency.

- The patient's ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is abnormal.
- The initial troponin level was elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.
- The patient's symptoms and history raise concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the etiology of the chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, which is a concerning symptom.
- The pain is described as pressure-like and radiates to the left shoulder and neck, which are common symptoms of cardiac chest pain.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death, which increases the suspicion for cardiovascular disease.
- The EMS EKG showed T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is abnormal and suggestive of ischemia.
- The patient has been experiencing exertional dyspnea, which can be a symptom of cardiac disease.
- The initial troponin was elevated and declining, indicating cardiac damage.
- The patient's physical exam is unremarkable, but it does not rule out a cardiac etiology for the chest pain.
- The patient is being admitted for further cardiac workup, indicating a high suspicion for ACS (acute coronary syndrome).","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning:
- The patient is a 38-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presenting with chest pain.
- The pain is described as pressure-like, radiating to the left shoulder and neck, and has been continuous for about an hour.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency.
- She has been experiencing exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks.
- There is a family history of heart attack in the mother at age 42 and sudden death in the father at age 50.
- The EMS EKG showed T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding.
- The initial troponin was elevated and declining.
- The patient's symptoms and history raise a high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the cause of her chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient is a 38-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presenting with chest pain, which started an hour ago and has been continuous since then. The pain is described as pressure-like and radiates to the left shoulder and neck. The patient also reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. 
- The patient has a family history of heart disease, with her mother having a heart attack at 42 and her father dying suddenly at 50. 
- The patient has never seen a cardiologist and has no prior stress testing. 
- The EMS EKG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding. 
- The initial troponin level is elevated, indicating possible myocardial damage. 
- The patient has been experiencing exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks. 
- Given these factors, there is a high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the cause of the chest pain. Cardiology has been consulted, and the plan is for admission for further cardiac workup.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has ST and T wave abnormality, which raises concern for anterior ischemia. This suggests a significant ST deviation (2 points) not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin. Therefore, the categorization would be [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

# Cellulitis
RLE has become much more painful. Wound appears infected with no systemic symptoms.
- vitals and HPI not suggestive of SIRS or sepsis, thus will elect to treat as outpatient for now
- provided patient and VNA with anticipatory guidance and when to go to the ED
- CBC, ESR, CRP, BMP
- Start doxycycline and Keflex
- f/u in 1 week to evaluate wound. If the wound has wider area of involvement, or if pain is worsening,
or if there is more drainage, would consider referral to the ED for more expedited workup and
consideration of IV antibiotics
- patient agreeable with plan of care


","Based on the information provided, the patient has the following risk factors:
1. Positive family history (parent had a heart attack at 42)
2. Chest pain (suggestive of possible ACS)
3. Abnormal ECG (T-wave inversions in anterior leads)
4. Elevated troponin levels

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has been continuous for about an hour. The pain is also associated with nausea. These symptoms are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency, and had trouble sleeping due to pain. This suggests a worsening pattern of symptoms.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack in the mother at age 42 and sudden death in the father at age 50, which increases the suspicion for cardiac issues.
- The patient has never seen a cardiologist and has no prior stress testing, indicating a lack of previous evaluation for potential cardiac conditions.
- The ECG performed by EMS shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding for cardiac ischemia.
- The initial troponin level was elevated and declining, suggesting cardiac injury.
- The patient has been admitted for further cardiac workup, indicating the seriousness of the situation.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Type: ED Visit
Provider: Physician


Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Provider: Registered Nurse


09:17 AM Pt reports 7/10 crushing substernal chest pain. L sided. – pleuritic. No infectious sx or sick
contacts. Received aspirin. Abnl ECG per EMS. Strong family hx. MD at bedside assessing patient.
10:23 AM Second troponin sent to lab.
10:55 AM Troponin elevated, cardiology MD at bedside evaluating pt. No active chest pain at this time.
11:40 PM Plan for adm to cardiology. Awaiting tele bed. Floor signout to RN given. Patient continues to
have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient is a 38-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presenting with chest pain.
- The chest pain is described as pressure-like, radiating to the left shoulder and neck, and has been continuous for about an hour.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency.
- She has been experiencing exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks.
- There is a family history of heart attack in her mother at the age of 42 and sudden death in her father at the age of 50.
- The EMS EKG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads.
- The initial troponin level was elevated and declining.
- The patient's symptoms and history raise concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the etiology of her chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has ST and T wave abnormalities, suggesting the possibility of anterior ischemia. This would be categorized as a significant ST deviation (2).","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has been continuous for about an hour. This is concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death, which increases the suspicion for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency.
- The patient has been having exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks.
- The EMS EKG shows t-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is abnormal and suggestive of cardiac ischemia.
- The initial troponin is elevated, indicating cardiac injury.
- The patient's pain has resolved, which can be seen in some cases of myocardial infarction.
- Cardiology has been consulted and there is a plan for admission for further cardiac workup.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""

HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been

no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Electronically Signed on 08-08-2023 09:12:54 EDT by


","Based on the EKG findings, the patient has ST and T wave abnormality, which raises concern for anterior ischemia. This indicates a significant ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin. Therefore, the categorization would be [Significant ST deviation (2)].","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Consider the following risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current, or smoking cessation ≤3 mo), positive family history (parent or sibling with CVD before age 65); atherosclerotic disease: prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease. 
 
 For the patient below, across all the combined encounter notes, how many risk factors are present? 
 [No known risk factors (0)] [1-2 risk factors (1)] [>= 3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease (2)] [Not enough information to determine Risk Factor score]
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your final choice, listing one option between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [No known risk factors (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

- The patient has a family history of heart attack and sudden death, which raises the suspicion for underlying cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has been experiencing exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks, which can be a symptom of cardiac dysfunction.
- The patient's ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding for ischemia.
- The initial troponin level was elevated, indicating myocardial injury.
- The patient's symptoms resolved and the pain is currently absent, but the high suspicion for ACS remains.

Given these factors, further cardiac workup and admission are warranted.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal

","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain that is radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has been continuous for about an hour. The pain is similar to previous episodes that have been increasing in frequency.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack in her mother at age 42 and sudden death in her father at age 50.
- The patient has been experiencing exertional dyspnea for the last few weeks.
- The EMS EKG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding.
- The initial troponin level was elevated and declining.
- The patient has no significant past medical history or cardiovascular risk factors.
- The chest x-ray was unremarkable, ruling out alternative etiologies.
- The patient is being admitted for further cardiac work-up.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Chest Pain
Arrives by EMS, 8/10 chest pain radiating to left shoulder, neck. Pressure-like. No hx MI. Abnl EMS EKG. Aspirin PTA.
HPI/PE:
is a 38 y/o woman with no significant PMH presenting to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
She reports that her chest pain started while she was making breakfast about an hour ago and has been
continuous since then. Pressure-like. Describes like “someone sitting on my chest”. Associated nausea,
no vomiting or diarrhea. Pain radiates into her left shoulder and neck. She reports multiple episodes of
similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency. Had trouble sleeping last night due to pain.
Has been having some exertional dyspnea climbing stairs for the last few weeks.
She denies any other shortness of breath.
No fevers, chills, or other infectious symptoms.
She does not have a personal history of CAD however she reports her mother had a heart attack when
she was 42 and her father died suddenly at 50.
She denies any history of DVT/PE.
She has a primary care doctor but hasn’t seen them recently. Has never seen a cardiologist. No prior
stress testing.
She received aspirin prior to my assessment and had an ECG performed by EMS which shows t-wave
inversions in the anterior leads.
MDM:
presents to the ED for evaluation of chest pain. While she has a limited medical history without
significant cardiovascular risk factors, she has a very concerning family history and a markedly abnormal
ECG. Given these considerations, I have high suspicion for ACS as the etiology of her chest pain. Chest x-
ray was obtained to assess for alternative etiologies and was unremarkable. Initial troponin noted to be
elevated though declining. Pain also resolved. Cardiology consulted, plan for admission for further
cardiac w/u.

have no chest pain at this time. Full cardiac monitor in place. Call button in reach. All side bars up.


","The patient's history is highly suspicious [Highly suspicious (2)]. 

Reasoning: 
- The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, described as pressure-like, and has been continuous for about an hour. The pain is also associated with nausea. These symptoms are concerning for cardiac etiology.
- The patient reports multiple episodes of similar pain over the last few days, increasing in frequency, and had trouble sleeping due to pain. This suggests a worsening pattern of symptoms.
- The patient has a family history of heart attack in the mother at age 42 and sudden death in the father at age 50, which increases the suspicion for cardiovascular disease.
- The patient has never seen a cardiologist and has no prior stress testing, indicating a lack of previous evaluation for cardiac conditions.
- The EMS EKG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads, which is a concerning finding for ischemia.
- The initial troponin is elevated and declining, further supporting the suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient's physical exam is relatively unremarkable, but the abnormal EKG and elevated troponin are more indicative of cardiac pathology.

Overall, the patient's history, symptoms, family history, abnormal EKG, and elevated troponin levels raise a high suspicion for ACS as the cause of the chest pain.","You are a cardiologist reviewing a patient's history during their current cardiac ED visit. Please be concise.

Please consider the patient's EKG findings. Would you categorize it as: 
 [Normal (0)] [Non-specific repolarization disturbance (1)] [Significant ST deviation (2)] [Not enough information to determine EKG score]
 
 Additional information: ""1 point: No ST deviation but LBBB, LVH, repolarization changes (e.g. digoxin); 2 points: ST deviation not due to LBBB, LVH, or digoxin""
 
 Please first explain your reasoning and then provide your choice between the answers above in brackets (e.g. [Normal (0)] ).
